				<p>Do you know of a great startup that you would like to see featured on Disruptage? Please send an email to <a href="mailto:tips@disruptage.com">tips@disruptage.com</a> with the startup's website and a brief explanation as to why you think the startup should be discussed by the community.</p>
				<p>As a reminder, here are the general attributes used to determine if a startup makes the cut for discussion:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The startup (product/service) must have <strong>excellent</strong> design. Someone who has never heard of the startup should know essentially what their unique value proposistion is within a few minutes of visiting their site.
					</li>
					<li>
						The company must be disruptive in nature. That is, they are trying to change a market or create a new one.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bonus points if you are able to make an introduction to a founder of the company to respond to the questions/comments of the community.
					</li>
